# Google Sheets and Python

Playing around with the [gspread](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API. Current use cases I have for this is pulling data 
from a django app and dumping in google sheets, which can be easily plugged into google data studio reports and consumed by clients
who just want quick (read-only) access to the "raw" data.
